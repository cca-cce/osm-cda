select the penguins dataset from the seaborn package and select a suitable dependent variable (and rename it as dep_var) and a few independent variables (renamed as indep_var_1, indep_var_2 and so on), then generate python code to accomplish the following data analysis steps without executing the code, and briefly summarize all steps afterwards:

Load data into a DataFrame called df.
Save the DataFrame as a TSV file (output_file_path = '/home/sol-nhl/rnd/d/quarto/osm-cda/csv/data.tsv')
Summary statistics of the DataFrame.
Retrieving the first five records.
Renaming columns.
Changing column types.
Filling missing values.
Removing missing values.
Removing duplicate records.

ok looks good.. please continue to generate the code to perform the following steps without executing the code, and briefly summarize all steps afterwards:

Load df from the TSV file (input_file_path = '/home/sol-nhl/rnd/d/quarto/osm-cda/csv/data.tsv')
Filtering data example.
Selecting the required columns.
Grouping data example.
Merging data with another DataFrame.
Calculating a new column.
Creating a Pivot table.
Save the DataFrame as a TSV file (output_file_path = '/home/sol-nhl/rnd/d/quarto/osm-cda/csv/data_pivot.tsv')
