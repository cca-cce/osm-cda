    "text": "In this part, we will cover the basics of Python, ensuring participants are comfortable with the foundational concepts needed to work effectively in social science. You’ll learn how to install Python, set up your environment, and run your first Python programs. We’ll also introduce essential concepts like variables, data types, and control structures. By the end of this section, you’ll have a solid understanding of Python’s syntax and be ready to dive into more advanced applications relevant to social science.\n\n\n\nThis section focuses on data analysis using Python’s powerful libraries like Pandas and NumPy. You will learn how to load, clean, and manipulate datasets commonly used in social science research. We’ll walk through operations such as filtering, grouping, and summarizing data, helping you uncover patterns and insights. Visualizing data with Matplotlib and Seaborn will also be covered, giving you the tools to present your findings effectively.\n\n\n\nIn social sciences, analyzing textual data is crucial for understanding trends, sentiments, and narratives. This part will introduce Python tools like spaCy and NLTK to help you process and analyze text data. You’ll learn how to clean, tokenize, and extract meaningful information from unstructured text. Techniques such as sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and topic modeling will be explored to give you the skills to analyze text-based research materials, such as interviews, articles, and social media posts.\n\n\n\nImage analysis is becoming increasingly relevant in social science research, especially with the rise of social media and visual data. In this section, you’ll learn how to process and analyze images using Python libraries like OpenCV and Pillow. We’ll cover techniques for loading images, performing basic manipulations, and extracting useful data such as colors, patterns, and objects. You’ll also explore more advanced applications like face detection and image classification, enabling you to work with visual data in your research.\n\n\n\nIn the final part, we’ll focus on collecting data using Python, an essential skill for any social science researcher. You’ll be introduced to web scraping techniques using BeautifulSoup and Scrapy, allowing you to gather data from websites. We’ll also cover working with APIs to retrieve structured data from online sources such as social media platforms, government databases, or research repositories. By the end of this section, you’ll be equipped with the tools to gather the data you need for your projects.\n\nThis is a Quarto website.\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites.",
