    "text": "Workshop link and Schedule\n\nPart 1: Getting Started\nIn this part, participants will be introduced to Python environments, with a focus on using Google Colab Notebooks, an accessible and powerful tool for coding in Python. We will cover the installation and setup process, ensuring everyone is ready to run Python code in their browsers. The session will also explore basic Python syntax, including variables, data types, and control structures like loops and conditionals, laying the foundation for more advanced applications in social science research.\n\n\nPart 2: Data Analysis\nThis section focuses on performing data analysis with Python, using libraries like Pandas for dataframe manipulation. Participants will learn how to load, clean, and transform data, enabling them to analyze datasets commonly used in social science. We’ll also dive into results visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn, teaching participants how to create informative charts and graphs to present their findings effectively.\n\n\nPart 3: Text Analysis\nIn this part, participants will explore the basics of text analysis in Python, starting with reading text data from various sources such as documents or online content. We will cover text tokenization, the process of breaking text into individual words or phrases, using libraries like spaCy and NLTK. This will allow participants to process, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from large volumes of textual data, such as social media posts or survey responses.\n\n\nPart 4: Image Analysis\nThe image analysis section will introduce participants to working with visual data in Python. We’ll cover how to read and process image content using libraries like OpenCV and Pillow. Participants will also explore basic object recognition techniques, learning how to detect and classify objects within images, which is particularly useful for social science fields that rely on visual data, such as media studies or behavioral analysis.\n\n\nPart 5: Data Collection\nThe final part of the workshop focuses on data collection techniques using Python. Participants will learn web scraping methods to gather data from websites using tools like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy. Additionally, we will explore how to design and run web experiments, allowing researchers to collect behavioral data from users in real-time. These skills will empower participants to gather the data they need for their social science research projects.\n\nThis is a Quarto website.\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites.",
